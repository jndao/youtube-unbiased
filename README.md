# Youtube Unbiased
A simple app that allows users to watch youtube videos without their opinions being swayed by other sentiments.  
  
# Why I made it  
The internet is a rough place, with many opinions being shared between a mass of people. Throughout my time browsing, I found such sentiments to increasingly obscure my own objectivity when seeing how good a video is, and this is when this idea crept into my head.  
I wanted a way to watch videos in peace, with a way for my own opinion to not be swayed by a video that was heavily liked or disliked, with such a desire culminating in this light app that allow an experience to occur!  

# What it removes  
The app itself depends on page to both render and change while it loads new things.  
Some things that it removes are:  
- Views and like/dislike counts when watching videos (still allows you to like/dislike the video)  
- Views from video suggestions  
- The entire comment section (does not allow you to post your own comments)  
- Subscriber count from both the video, and the channel's own page  
  
Please note that this is quite a basic app and I am planning to add more features in the near future!  
  
# How to use it

Have fun and thanks for checking this out :)
